    <h1>Fighter Battle to the Death</h1>
    <h2>Rules: The goal of this game is to battle your opponent to the death.
         This is done by attacking them until their fatigue is zero.
         The computer will fight back and chooses their decision to attack or defend randomly. 
         Each character also has some natural armor even when not defending, granting damage reduction.
         When your fatigue is twice theirs or their fatigue is below 0,
         you can finishing blow them and knock them out if it hits (passes through defend).
         Fatigue is healed by a bit every time a character is not attacked.
         Stats of each fighter is shown below their image along with their previous action.</h2>
